  Our project is recreating the game Crossy Road. It uses graphics and letter 
  keys to move the character around on the screen. The main objective is to get
  to the top of the screen (i.e. the maximum number of steps the character takes) 
  without dying. The interface can be programmable if the user wishes to change 
  the number of obstacles present or the size of them.

  Standard visual I/O is supported.
