  Our project is recreating the game Crossy Road. It uses graphics and arrow 
  keys to move the character around on the screen. The main objective is to get
  the highest possible score (i.e. how many steps the character takes) without
  dying. The interface can be programmable if the user wishes to change difficulty
  levels of the speed of the objects and how many lives the user can have to continue 
  their run before getting the final score.

  Standard visual I/O is supported, but the game can also emit sound 
  when the character dies.
